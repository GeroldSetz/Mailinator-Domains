# Mailinator-Domains
This repository is being generated based on the data of www.block-disposable-email.com. Updates committed on a daily basis as long as additions appear.

## What you get
The data you can download at https://github.com/GeroldSetz/Mailinator-Domains/blob/master/mailinator_domains_from_bdea.cc.txt is a list of domains in sha1 format (lowercase hashed). 
Example: "mailinator.com" will be represented as "f65f8e182b0ecc8a1ec02aff22b2c26fabdb954b". 

## Intention
The intention of this file is to let you check your userbase or new subscribers against this managed blacklist to detect fake subscribers. We have chosen not to disclose plain text domain names as they might be used for fraud attempts - which runs contrary to our ideas. As mentioned the data comes from our main project www.block-disposable-email.com, which already serves thousands of clients.

What we provide here is a specific subset of our comprehensive blacklist which contains domains only that are hosted by mailinator.com. The set of data includes domains added at least 30 days ago. However, we suppose it is the most accurate data you can find for free anyway. 
In case the community finds the data useful I'll publish domains of other main-providers in the same way.

## Upgrades
If you are looking for more up-to-data dea domains please take our api into consideration or use one of the existing modules for standard software (such as Wordpress, phpBB, Java, ...) . It includes hundreds of alternative domains of well-known temporary email provider such as Yopmail, discard.email, mytemp.email, 10minutemail, generator.email as well as widely unrecognised services. 

Feedback, suggestions, ... appreciated.
