# Mailinator-Domains
This repository id beeing generated based on the data of www.block-disposable-email.com.

The data you can download here is a list of domains in sha1 (lowecase hashed) format. Example: "mailinator.com" --> "f65f8e182b0ecc8a1ec02aff22b2c26fabdb954b". It helps to check your userbase without the need to disclose plain text domain names (which would be silly as the purpose of this list is to decrease fraud attempts).
